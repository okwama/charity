                                    <h3>Health and Nutrition Programmes </h3>
                                    <p>Adequate health and nutrition is essential for the healthy development of children. Families affected by illness may not be able to work or provide proper care.  Children in these situations are at risk of dropping out of school in order to care for a sick adult and work in order to replace lost income.  If the caretaker dies from the illness, the child risks a number of negative outcomes including living on the street or being placed in institutional care.</p>
                                    <br>
                                    <p>The provision of free or affordable health and nutrition services is vital in the protection of children and in reducing separation from their caretakers.  This need is extremely prevalent in areas affected by large scale HIV/AIDS infection rates, poverty, and armed conflict. 
                                      Children who have been abused or exploited require immediate health screening to identify and treat potential injury and infections.  Medical testing and treatment should be delivered in a child sensitive manner, with consent and confidentiality standards strictly adhered to.  Significant health interventions should also be accompanied by psychosocial services, education, and family support.</p>
                                </li>
                            </ol>

                                    <h3>Education Programmes  </h3>
                                    <p>Education is a fundamental element in the ability of children to meet their developmental potential.  It promotes their mental, physical and psychosocial health, and offers a sense of normalcy, even in times of conflict.  Schools are ideal for encouraging awareness of issues which place children at risk and increase the likelihood of child separation, such as HIV/AIDS prevention and child abuse.  </p>
                                    <br>
                                    <p>Teachers themselves can help identify instances of abuse and neglect, and refer families to services that can help prevent family separation.  Such awareness raising activities should also complement wider community work projects, in order to maximise their impact.</p>
                                    <br>
                                    <p>The type of curriculum and provision should be determined according to the cultural norms, needs of the children, and the available resources.  These may vary considerably; for example children who support others and are required to work will need flexible hours for classes or vocational training, while those in a conflict affected area may require full-time education with an emphasis on psychosocial activities.</p>
                                  
                                  </li>

                                    <h3>Psychosocial Support</h3>
                                    <p>The best form of psychosocial support is a healthy family and supportive environment, preferably in the child's community of origin, or one that is culturally similar.  Psychosocial well-being is a product of multiple support, which is rooted in the ability to form healthy relationships and participate in community networks.   
                                      However, certain considerations may be required in order to help children and caretakers come to terms with life-changing events, such as the loss of a parent.  Separation can be highly stressful for children, particularly if it is unexpected, or repeated.  Some children may experience anxiety, attachment problems, sleep disturbances, dependency issues, regression, and a range of other behavioural issues which threaten their mental health and development. </p>
                                    <br>
                                    <p>Specific types of support may be required for children suffering from loss, severe or chronic ill health, abuse or exploitation. The child’s experience, age, resilience, and the level of support received from the family and community will determine if a child needs external services. A child is far less likely to experience psychosocial stress if they have good natural support mechanisms and therefore protection efforts should focus on supporting families and communities to help each other.  </p>
                                    <br>
                                    <p>When psychosocial support is needed, an assessment is important in determining the scope and type of issues, the existing family and community resources, and analysis of how these can be strengthened.  Clinical mental health interventions such as therapy, psychiatry or psychological counseling, should only be provided by trained professionals after a clinical assessment and, in all cases, should be culturally relevant.  </p>
                                    <br>
                                    <p>Psychosocial activities must promote the children’s development and their relationships with others, re-establish routines, increase self-confidence and sense of control over their lives.  Children’s activities, such as the provision of safe places, group work or referrals to specialists, should be designed around the child’s individual needs, age, gender, and cultural identity.  Interventions should be empowering, inclusive, and fully integrated with wider community efforts.  Children’s participation is essential in psychosocial work; children should be encouraged to express their opinions, and to have these taken into account.</p>

                                    <h3>Household Economic Strengthening </h3>
                                    <p>Poverty is a leading cause of child separation.  Families may be torn apart by the stresses of trying to provide for their basic needs, and children may be abandoned or exploited for financial purposes.  Household economic strengthening aims to reduce a family’s vulnerability to poverty, increase economic independence, and improve people’s ability to provide for their children. </p>

                                    <br>
                                    <p>Economic strengthening alone will not prevent separation or protect children, and should form part of a comprehensive support package, including psychosocial work, community mobilisation, education, health, and family support.  Household economic strengthening should also complement the wider government social assistance programmes, welfare sector initiatives, and child care policies.  Beneficiaries should include those families which are destitute, poor, or vulnerable to poverty, including child headed households. </p>
                                    <br>
                                    <p>Economic empowerment is not possible without the active participation of the community in ensuring that those most in need are identified and that families are willing to commit to projects.  Any initiative must have sustainability at its core; there must be a market demand for products and services, and activities should build on the existing strengths and resources of the community.</p>
                                    <br>
                                    <p>Household economic strengthening includes activities which help a family restore, improve and maintain their income, and build savings and assets.  Projects may consist of relief assistance, grants and loans for income generating activities, technical and skills training, registered credit and savings associations, and legal advice on inheritance and property rights.  Ideally such guidance and resources should come from specialised local organisations that can facilitate market research, identify those in need and the type of assistance required, and provide sustainable long-term support to beneficiaries.  </p>

                                    <h3> Particular Threats to Children's Care and Protection</h3>

                                    <p>PITARP works to address threats to children care and protection such as family breakdown, separation of children from their parents, and the need for child protection and care services, stem from a multitude of problems which affect children, families, and communities.  </p>
                                    <BR>
                                      <p><b>i). Child Abuse and Neglect</b></p>
                                      <p>Child abuse includes all forms of physical and emotional mistreatment, sexual abuse, and neglect of a child’s basic needs, which results in actual or potential harm to a child’s physical, mental, and emotional health. Exploitation of children is also a form of abuse and includes trafficking for sexual or economic purposes, and recruitment of children into armed forces.
                                        An abused child may experience many forms of mistreatment in any one incident or over time; for example, emotional harm is a pervading factor in all types of abuse. The abuser may be a family member, a stranger, another child, or someone responsible for a child's well-being, such as a teacher or caretaker. </p>
                                        <br><p>Children in every society are vulnerable to abuse, gender based violence, and exploitation, however children without parental care and those in high risk environments such as conflict areas, refugee camps, on the street, or in institutions, are particularly exposed to violence, denial of their basic human rights, and deprivation. All abuse has its origins in power imbalance and therefore is typically associated with fear, secrecy, and control. This makes identifying and speaking out about abuse very difficult for children, family members, the community and social services, particularly when it is committed within the privacy of the home. </p>    
                                        <br> <p>Child abuse can cause physical and psychosocial problems, including HIV/AIDS infection, and is particularly damaging when repeated over a period of time. Children may manifest abuse via destructive or withdrawn behaviours, developmental delays, injuries or other health problems. The effects of abuse will vary from child to child and depend on the source, type and extent of the abuse, the child’s developmental stage and their disposition or resilience. </p>
                                        <br><p>process of identifying and responding to abuse requires skilled interventions in order to prevent further harm to the child, and will typically include police, medical, psychological, and social services in order to address the safety, physical, and emotional needs of the affected children. Any care plan must be in the best interests of the child and protect them and their siblings from harm. This will include consideration of the additional risks of abuse that are present for children in institutions and care placements. Such closed environments are extremely susceptible to abuse since they are frequently isolated, insufficiently regulated, and lacking in adequate supervision and safe reporting procedures. It is the role of social services to screen and monitor all child placements, including institutional, kinship, and foster care, to ensure the child’s safety and well-being. </p>
                                        <br><p>It is the responsibility of the whole community to protect its children. Education and community awareness for children and adults on the risks, signs of abuse, and responses is vital for children without parental care and those in high risk situations, such as during a conflict or displacement when sexual violence, exploitation, and recruitment into armed forces are prevalent.</p>

                                    <h3>Children with Disabilities </h3>
                                    <br><p>A disability includes a physical impairment such as mobility, hearing, visual, and language difficulties, and developmental delays which affect a person’s behaviour, emotional expression, and learning abilities. It includes mild to severe disabilities, from cerebral palsy, paralysis and amputation, to blindness, deafness, autism, and dyslexia. Children may be born with an impairment, or develop one as a result of disease, abuse, or an injury, e.g. many children are the victims of shootings, bombings, and explosions in conflict affected areas. </p>
                                      <br><p>The degree of disability a person experiences is frequently related to society’s adaptation to meet the needs of people with varying abilities. This is known as the social model of disability which highlights the role of the environment in reducing or increasing the ability of individuals to participate equally in everyday life. For example, a person in a wheelchair has the impairment of not being able to walk. The disability, however, may be that he cannot take up services due to a lack of building access. Protection workers must consider any additional needs or risk factors a person may have as a result of his impairment and disability. Children in developing countries are more vulnerable to disability since poverty and conflicts increase the incidence of impairments, and reduce the provision of necessary health, education, social services, and adaptive provisions to help include children of all abilities. </p>
                                      <br><p>Children with impairments or special needs are highly vulnerable to discrimination, abandonment, abuse, exploitation, injury and death, since they are more reliant on the cooperation and support of others to meet their basic needs, and may be less able to express their wishes. In some cultures, children with special needs are actively excluded from participating in society since they may be viewed as a source of shame, or unworthy of care and protection. <br>
                                      <br><p>Government policies should seek to reduce the incidence of injuries and diseases via adequate health care, including education, immunizations, nutrition, and sanitation. All programming and policies for children should promote the social inclusion of children with disabilities at every level. Children should benefit from the reduction of physical and social barriers, adaptation of services and/or rehabilitation assistance in order to enable them to participate as fully as possible in their communities. This includes family support, health facilities, access to education, and respite services to enable children to fulfill their potential. Children of all abilities must be empowered to express their views and to influence their own lives. </p>
                                      <br><p>The resources in this section focus on children with disabilities in developing countries, and those affected by conflict. They highlight their vulnerability to exclusion and abuse, and provide examples of projects to address the needs of children with special needs.</p>

                                    <h3>School programs</h3>
                                    <p>Primary education has been free in Kenya since 2003 however the reality of a government funded education for over 6 million pupils in more than 20,000 primary schools is that limited financial resources are spread very thinly when faced with the demands of employing sufficient teachers, providing adequate resources and investing in facilities and infrastructure.
                                      In schools, particularly those in rural areas, this manifests itself in high class enrolments, dilapidated and cramped classrooms, and an acute shortage of even the most basic learning resources. Furthermore, pupil welfare suffers in the face of unhygienic sanitation facilities, a lack of clean drinking water and the absence of feeding programmes.
                                      These challenges have a severe impact on absenteeism and drop-out, the quality of teaching and learning, and ultimately of course on academic attainment and performance.
                                      The introduction of free primary education set Kenya on the way to attaining one of the key Millennium Development Goals of universal primary education. But it needs the support of development partners to make it an education worth having.</p>

                                    <h3>WELFARE AND WELLBEING</h3>
                                    <p>Our work is not just about building the capacity of the schools, it also about improving the capacity of the pupils to learn. Our welfare programmes aim to improve pupil well-being so that they are physically able to learn and study, not tired from or distracted by thirst, hunger or ill-health.
                                     <br> <h6>Feeding</h6>
                                      With donor funding, we hope to provide a daily lunch to every pupil in our partner schools  to helps fuel bodies and minds for productive learning.
                                      <br><h6>Sanitation (WASH)</h6>
                                      With donor funding we hope to install safe, modern and hygienic latrines, with private washroom facilities for girls and separate dedicated staff latrines.
                                      <br><h6>Water</h6>
                                      We hope to mobilize funds to improve water supplies and storage capacity to ensure there is no day without water for drinking and/or washing in school.
                                      <br><h6>Our proposed School lunch programme</h6>
                                      We hope to provide a daily hot lunch to more than 2,000 pupils across our network of partner schools and beyond who, in the absence of any government funded programme, would otherwise go through the day learning on an empty stomach. By providing a daily lunch to children in school we remove hunger as a barrier to learning as it encourages pupils to attend school in the first place and then keeps them there throughout the day.
                                      The programme was launched in September 2019 but was interrupted by the onset of COVID 19 and has never picked up, the donor pulled out as a result of the COVID 19 pandemic. Once it picks up we would like to  keep the children in schools.
                                      <br><h6>Water security</h6>
                                      Access to water is a right; but one which those of us who are fortunate to have it piped to our homes all too often take for granted. It is simply not acceptable in the 21st century that schools in the Sub Sahara region do not have access to a reliable supply of clean water which is needed for drinking, cooking, hand-washing and cleaning. We hope to improve water security in our partner schools by establishing rainwater harvesting capacity and connections to other supplies of water. During times of drought, when these sources dry up, we also deliver emergency supplies of water to those schools that need it.</p>
