                                 <h4  style="font-weight: bolder;">REPRODUCTIVE MATERNAL NEONATAL CHILD AND ADOLESCENT HEALTH </h4>
                               <br>  <p>PITARP recognizes that reproductive health services including family planning are essential in enhancing the well-being of women and their families. Ensuring access to voluntary family planning provides women with options to prevent unintended pregnancies while reducing the risk of maternal and child mortality, and improving the health and economic well-being of families and communities. Research demonstrates that family planning is an essential component of achieving development goals for health, poverty reduction, gender equality, and environmental sustainability, including Kenya’s Vision 2030, a national framework for development. Research at PITARP contributes to knowledge on FP and FP related measurements in Kenya. FP intervention projects contribute to increased knowledge and access, and changes in attitude towards FP. We have also stepped up our interventions against cervical cancer and we aim at curbing the number of deaths from cervical cancer through promoting early diagnosis, treatment of precancerous lesions and where possible linkage to advanced treatment as needed.</p>
                             <br><p>Exclusive breastfeeding is a critical key in achieving SDG 2 and SDG3 -- which include ending hunger, improving nutrition and promoting health and wellbeing.  And increasingly, it is clear that <b> breastfeeding is not only the cornerstone of a child’s healthy development; it is also the foundation of a Country’s development.</b> In fact, supporting breastfeeding is one of the smartest investments countries can make in the wellbeing of their citizens. the benefits for individuals, families and societies include ending preventable child deaths, improving maternal and child health, boosting educational attainment, and increasing productivity.</p>
                             <br><p>Many women in Western Kenya  face gaps in access to high-quality ANC: they often do not receive the recommended services for a healthy pregnancy, experience poor quality of care, and are treated disrespectfully. Young and adolescent women, particularly first time mothers, tend to complete fewer ANC visits and seek care later in pregnancy than adult mothers. Shortage of medicine and supplies, insufficient skilled health providers, and heavy staff workloads reduce quality of care available and may create compassion fatigue in providers, translating to disrespectful treatment of pregnant women.1 As a result, while most women attend at least one ANC visit (83%), just over half complete the four or more ANC visits (64%)2 long recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO). New guidelines by the WHO in 20163 recommending a minimum of eight antenatal contacts pose even greater challenges. In Kenya, most women attend at least one ANC visit (97%), and 60% of women complete the recommended four or more visits.4 A higher proportion of adolescent girls do not utilize ANC or skilled care during delivery (only 49% of young people under age received any ANC as compared to 60% between 20-34 years).  Kakamega County lags behind the rest of the country on several maternal and neonatal health indicators. Only 51% of women receive at least four antenatal visits, just over 20% receive any care during the first trimester of pregnancy, and slightly less than half (47%) deliver with a skilled birth attendant (national average: 61%).</p>
                              <br><p><b>Our Strategies:</b>
                            <br><b>1.</b> Lea Mimba : Kakamega County has some of the highest maternal and newborn mortality in Kenya. Only 51% of women receive at least four antenatal visits, and slightly less than half (47%) deliver with a skilled birth attendant. Formation of ANC groups (lea mimba clubs): The group format provides a forum for women to share and gain knowledge, develop confidence, and build a sense of community. Group models can help support women’s ability to enact healthy behaviors, and can contribute to shifting the power dynamic between women and health providers.
                        <br><b>2.</b> Kangaroo mother care :  Kangaroo Mother Care (KMC) offers a low-cost, easy to adopt solution to improving the health and survival rates of pre-term and low birth-weight babies.In Kenya, 22 newborn babies in every 1,000 live births lose their lives within the first month (28 days) of life. It refers to the prolonged and continuous skin-to-skin contact between a mother (or other caregiver) and the preterm or low-birth weight baby for up to 24 hours a day. Besides prolonged, continuous skin-to-skin contact, KMC also promotes exclusive breastfeeding of the infant. KMC allows for early discharge of the mother from a facility, and can therefore be practiced both in hospital and within the community. Available evidence indicates that, among low-birth weight new-born and preterm babies, KMC decreases mortality by 36% (Boundy, 20167). The innovation has other benefits – it boosts the infant’s mental development, and helps the baby to adapt as the temperature is maintained and does not require to be regulated. It also promotes healthy weight gain, makes breastfeeding easier, promotes bonding between carer and infant, and reduces incidences of postpartum depression.</p>

                            <h4  style="font-weight: bolder;">Adolescent and Youth Sexual and Reproductive Health and Policy Rights (AYSRHR)</h4>
                            <br><p>For millions of young people around the world, the onset of adolescence brings not only changes to their bodies but also new vulnerabilities to human rights abuses. Many girls are forced into unwanted sex, early marriage, female genital mutilation, and cultural practices which puts them at risk of unwanted pregnancies, unsafe abortions, sexually transmitted infections (STIs) including HIV, and dangerous childbirth. In Kenya, majority of new HIV infections are among young people. Similarly, about one fifth of girls below 19 years have begun childbirth. Our programs aim to provide evidence to guide understanding of sexual and reproductive health issues for adolescents and young people, including unintended pregnancy drivers and HIV vulnerabilities. We also strive, where possible, to scale up evidence-based SRH approaches to improve outcomes</p>

                            <h4  style="font-weight: bolder;">Sexual and Gender-Based Violence (SGBV)</h4>
                            <br><p>In Kenya, it is estimated that up to 30% of girls and 18% of boys experience sexual violence by the age of 18 years. Sexual Violence is associated with adverse sexual and reproductive (SRH) health, increased mental health problems and alcohol and substance abuse disorders. SGBV research and interventions at PITARP aim to provide evidence on individual and community factors associated with SGBV and theoretical models underlying health seeking for SGBV services and provide evidence to scale-up quality SBGV prevention and response interventions. PITARP supports comprehensive SGBV services through the Sexual and Gender-based Violence Center at Coast General Teaching and Referral Hospital. PITARP also supports school-based interventions targeting to build knowledge and empower young boys and girls on their rights to be protected from sexual violence.</p>

                            <br><p><b>Behaviour change communication targeting the Key Populations</b>
                            <br>Key Populations (MSM, FSW, TG) have high HIV rates and contribute significantly to new infections. FSW have almost five times the HIV prevalence as women from the general population, while MSM have about four times that of the national prevalence. KP also experience high rates of sexual and gender-based violence, societal stigma and discrimination, all of which increase vulnerabilities to HIV/STI and mental health issues. Our research and projects provide evidence on the cost-effective interventions to scale-up HIV/STI services to key populations. 
                        <br><b>Interventions targeting sexual and gender minorities : </b>
                    <br><b>I)  LGBTQ2S centred programs:</b>
                    PITARP received their first funding in 2019 from the Canadian Fund for Local Initiatives which was aimed at improving services for the LGBTQ2S community through training of key stakeholders and the establishment of a resource centre in Kakamega, Kenya. The following activities were undertaken :</p>
                        <br><p>1).  To establish a centre where LGBTQ2S persons can access health and legal services: This was done; we established the centre in October 2019 and furnished it in November. The centre is the staff meeting point; it has been very vital in holding peer educators meetings, access to information, education and communication products including condoms and lubricants, it is a data tools as well as reports storage centre (has lockable cabinets) and it provides counselling services as well as referrals for legal aid. PITARP CBO resource centre is the first centre of its kind in Matungu Sub County and the only centre for LGBTQ2S in Kakamega County. 
                            <br><p style="font-style: italic;font-weight: bold;"> Quote: “Whaww! This is a very nice place.” Almasi, a visiting gay peer from neigbouring Sub County in Kakamega County. </p> 
                <br><p>2).  To conduct a 2 days training for 30 health care professionals working in the County on provision of LGBTQ2S friendly health care. This activity was done: It was the very first activity of its kind in Matungu Sub County and PITARP CBO is the first organization to train health care professionals in Matungu Sub County. During our training, most health care workers were able to interact with the LGBTQ2S community for the very first time in their life. The training enabled the health care workers to unravel the mystery behind the façade of the LGBTQ2S as most of the time they presented themselves as general populations for treatment at health facility for fear of discrimination. The health care professionals promised to work with PITARP CBO to improve services delivery to the LGBTQ2S community. We were able to locate a volunteer contact health provider to handle all our referred cases. The creation of an LGBTQ2S friendly environment at health facilities has improved our referral system; increased case identification and linkages to care. </p>
                <p style="font-style: italic;font-weight: bold;">Quote i: “Thank you CFLI, your funding enabled us to recognize PITARP CBO who were in hiding, now we have been trained on how to engage with them and are assuring you of our total support for the organization.” Mr. Wesonga  during the CFLI visit. 
                <br>Quote ii: Thank you for funding this program, we appreciate your efforts to train us and enable the LGBTQ2S community who were still in hiding get health services. I would also suggest that you plan to extend your support for PITARP by supporting them employ one nursing officer to carry out cervical cancer screening and dispense ARV drugs to their peers living with HIV. Dr. Patrick during CFLI visit
                <br>Quote iii: “Thank you PITARP CBO for the good work you are doing to ensure the LGBTQ2S living with HIV are adhering to treatment and attending their clinics as required. We hope this will go along way to ensure all of them are virally suppressed. ” Dr. Peter – The Lab officer , Matungu Sub County hospital.
                <br>Qoute iv:  “We appreciate PITARP CBO for serving our people, Your efforts towards providing HIV counselling and testing services have yielded more fruit as close to  65% of LGBTQ2S i have interacted with know how to utilize preventive commodities. Lets continue and grow up this partnership.” Dr. Masinde – in-charge of ART,  Matungu Sub County hospital. </p>
                        
            <p>3).  To conduct a 3 days training for 20 LGBTQ2S peer educators on HIV prevention, gender and SGBV. The activity was done; again this was the first training for LGBTQ2S community in Matungu Sub County; the training improved our visibility, increased access to comprehensive and well-coordinated health services provision for the LGBTQ2S community in Matungu Sub County, it enabled the hard to test (tops) to access health services and also enabled LGBTQ2S diagnosed with HIV to access treatment and care.
                <br><p style="font-weight: bold;font-style: italic;">Quote i : “Congratulations to our donor, You  have created an environment which promotes us to feel comfortable enough to talk about things that typically won’t be spoken about … where LGBTQ2S peers can speak up, where they feel like nothing that’s going to be said is going to be taken out and used against them.” Ogola, One of the peers present during CFLI visit.
                    <br>Quote ii. “Thank you for the good quality services at your Resource centre, thank you for the tea, we need quality services like this one on every stop over points to enable LGBTQ2S access health education, condoms  and lubricants. ’’ Evans Oluoch, an LBGTQ peer from Busia.</p>
            </p>

            <br><p>4). To conduct training for 20 lawyers and 50 law enforcers: This was the first training that the law enforcers and lawyers have ever had in Western region in Kenya; By engaging with the lawyers on human rights of the LGBTQ2S, the focus was on provision of pro-borno services and on direct client representation while the law enforcers were to protect LGBTQ2S community members against extortion, arbitrary arrests, unnecessary frequent raids on LGBTQ2S hotspots, discrimination in public places, law enforcement play a key role in HIV prevention and national public health outcomes. The training was aimed at enhancing the police buy-in towards supporting LGBTQ2S access to health services, reducing violence against LGBTQ2S since they are the major perpetrators; address the stigmatizing and discriminatory attitudes to help improve LGBTQ2S health and human rights. The training for the lawyers and the law enforcers achieved the following outcomes: 
                i. It build partnership both at national and local level to engage the law enforcers proactively; we were lucky to have a representative from the National AIDS/STIs control program (NASCOP) to attend the meeting. 
                ii. It enabled us to identify champions and ambassadors for the LGBTQ2S community in Matungu Sub county ; 2 police officers came out as volunteer ambassadors to support LGBTQ2S whenever they are violated.
                iii. The peer-to-peer approach and knowledge management ; the police were encouraged to train their colleagues back at the police stations where they came from to enable them know how to engage with LGBTQ2S. 
                <br><p style="font-weight: bold;font-style: italic;"> Quote i. “Thank you for funding the program, The law enforcers training was good, it was the only one we have ever had in this region. The training was an eye opener; all the participants were happy discussing issues facing LGBTQ2S, i realized that even some of our law enforcers were part of the LGBTQ2S network yet they were in hiding. I believe this is the new face of HIV prevention required to turn the tide against AIDS. ’’ Senior OCS Matungu Sub County, Mr. Fredrick Ndiege, during the CFLI visit in Matungu sub County.
                Quote ii: “Although my work is involving, i am always ready to provide legal support to LGBTQ2S community following the training we had. However, LGBTQ2S is a new concept to most lawyers and as such it requires continuous sensitization so that we can form a formidable team of lawyers who can advocate for LGBTQ2S equality and shun discrimination.” Lawyer Luchivia, during CFLI visit.
                Quote iii “This is great work , keep it up. I am willing to support you in any way possible to end gender based and other forms of violence in Matungu Sub County. Further more, i would like to request if you can extend your work in 2 or more Sub Counties to benefit LGBTQ2S peers.’’ Mr. James , the Matungu Sub County Commissioner
                Quote iv : Thank you for the good work reaching out to the community with friendly services is encouraging. The work you are doing in Matungu is great, keep it up. Mr. Mark , the Koyonzo police inspector.  </p>
           
                <br><p>5). Create a website for the centre to showcase our activities. The website is now up and running, it is being updated whenever we have an activity to enhance access to the international LGBTQ2S community as well as the CFLI team. One of the major challenges in the website was hosting whereby after making our first payments to safaricom it was revealed that we had not paid the hosting fee last year 2018 and went ahead to deny us hosting so we had to look for another provider to host our website. </p>

                <br><p>6). Establish a hotline number through which all cases of violence against LGBTQ2S will be reported. This was done, the phone and sim were bought and it was connected to the head of police headquarter in Matungu. The other challenge here was that the police officers who provided security during training for peer educators including their head were all transferred last week and a new team is in place and so we need to start the identification process afresh. Secondly, we wanted to get a toll free line from Safaricom but this went in vain and so we decided to buy a normal line but we encourage LGBTQ2S peers facing violence to page the line and we call them because the line has airtime. Our number +254734098480 is in use at the Resource centre; the LGBTQ2S flash/page and are called for free since we have monthly airtime for the phone; similarly the airtime is used to offer free Wi-Fi at our Resource centre which enable LGBTQ2S peers to browse, chat with friends on face book, WhattsApp etc.
                    <br><p style="font-weight: bold;font-style: italic;">Quote i: “Thank you Mr. Director for opening our eyes, we never knew that one day we shall receive an advocate to support our work, help us manage our operations and be there to support us when violated. Thank you once more for your support, it is greatly appreciated.” Mrs. Violet – a wines and spirits owner. 
                        <br>Quote ii: “Thank you PITARP CBO for the good job.” Hadija, LGBTQ2S peer.
                    <br>Quote iii: “Thank you PITARP for giving us information; now we can protect ourselves as well as protect our peers from STI/HIV.” Savior, a peer educator.</p>
                </p>
                <br><p>7). Payment of peer educators stipend and staff salaries: All PE stipend was paid as planned. Similarly all staff salaries were paid. All the PES submitted in their reports for the month of Feb 2020 at the end of the month of Feb 2020. The peer educator stipend has enhanced efficiency in program implementation.   </p>

                            <h4  style="font-weight: bolder;text-align: center;">OTHER KEY ACHIEVEMENTS DURING THE IMPLEMENTATION PERIOD</h4>
                            <br><ol> 
                                <li><b>I).</b> 987(25 Lesbians, 819 MSMs, 56 Bi-females , 87 Trans females) were reached with HIV prevention interventions through the peer educators at the ratio of 1:49. </li>
                                <li><b>II).</b> 568(15 Lesbians, 454 MSMs, 37 Bi-females, 62 Trans females) were tested for HIV at PITARP CBO DIC to determine their sero status. 45 hard to test MSM were tested with HIV self-test kits at their homes.   </li>
                                <li><b>III). </b> 4 MSMs were enrolled with known-positive status, currently on care; their viral loads were done and are virally suppressed.  </li>
                                <li><b>IV).  </b> 587(18 Lesbians, 455 MSMs, 46 Bi-female, 68 Trans females) referred for STI screening at Matungu Sub County Hospital were screened for STIs and 24(3 Lesbians, 15 MSMs,2 Bi-females, 4 Trans) were diagnosed with STI and were treated for the same at the hospital.</li>
                                <li><b>V). </b> 38, 786 male Condoms and 2,134 female condoms were distributed by peer educators to the LGBTQ2S hotspots directly to their peers to ensure safe sexual practices.</li>
                                <li><b>VI). </b> 55 LGBTQ2S peers reported cases of physical and emotional violence; most of these cases were involving peers and bouncers while some involved peers and the law enforcers. All the cases were solved at hotspots.</li>
                            </ol>
                            <p>We encountered significant challenges implementing project activities( being the first activities in Matungu Sub County) :
                              <br>Despite our efforts in reaching LGBTQ2S peers with HIV testing services at our safe space we had insufficiency in supply of HIV test Kits but resolved these by borrowing from Bungoma County; we also lacked lubricants due to the nationwide stock outs.
                              <br>Stigma and discrimination on LGBTQ2S community is still high which makes some LGBTQ2S peers fear accessing services at health facilities even after referrals to such services; our nurse had to do escorted referrals to ensure the LGBTQ2S peers accessed services. Most lesbians and bisexuals feared opening up to their peers: they could only confide to the nurse for testing but rejected enrolment to the program due to stigma and the fear of discrimination by immediate family members.
                              <br>Criminalization of the LGBTQ2S community is still high; this was witnessed during the law enforcers sensitization whereby being the first sensitization in Matungu Sub County  the law enforcers at one point brought the training to a halt claiming that it contravened the law of the land . We had to explain to them that this was a Ministry of health training aimed at ensuring provision of health services to the key populations as well as well as ensuring there was a perception shift to ensure access to health, legal, information and social services ; the senior police officers had to come on board, they explained to their juniors what the training meant i.e for peaceful co-existence, to curb violence at hotspots, ensure security for the LGBTQ2S community. After their bosses addressing the issues, the training went on as planned and fruitful discussions were made. 
                              <br>Ignorance by religious leaders : An LGBTQ2S peer initially diagnosed with HIV and linked to a health facility for treatment was coerced by his pastor to discontinue ART terming the drugs as evil. The peer had started developing rashes luckily he visited our safe space and met our nurse for health education and was  advised to continue taking his drugs. He is now well and healthy. He said: Quote <p style="font-style: italic;">– ‘”Thank you for opening the safe space to deliver health services to LGBTQ2S, without you guys I would be dead and buried. Thank you nurse and thank you PITARP CBO.”</p>
                              On the same note we also faced a challenge of handling violence; in November 2019, one of our LGBTQ2S peers was assaulted by bouncers at his hotspot. We intervened and took the matter to the law enforcers but the perpetrator was released after 2 days for lack of evidence; the other LGBTQ2S peers feared for their lives and could not provide evidence. We therefore need funds for responding to violence and continuous capacity building for the LGBTQ2S peers to report cases as well as have knowledge on legal literacy. Secondly we also need to sensitize the police to handle LGBTQ2S cases with caution because some of them fear talking.  There is also the need to train a section of LGBTQ2S as paralegals to better sensitize other LGBTQ2S members as well as handle violence.

                              <br>Integrated health Interventions targeting the key populations in Kakamega County
                              Goal : Working towards universal access to services for key populations to contribute to improved health, inclusion and social wellbeing for KPs as well as to strengthen the institutional and advocacy capacity.
                              Objectives :
                              <br><b>I).</b> To decrease the number of persons at high risk of acquiring and transmitting HIV
                              <br><b>II).</b> Increase the proportion of HIV-infected people who know their status
                              <br><b>III).</b >Increase the proportion of HIV-infected people who receive prevention services
                              <br><b>IV).</b> Strengthen capacity to monitor , implement and evaluate prevention programs</b>
                            </p>
                            <p>While many countries have scaled up HIV testing in health clinics, civil society representatives have called for more community friendly approaches, focusing on key populations who often do not attend clinics.  by bringing together sex workers, upholding voices of sex workers in advocating for the rights of female, male and transgender sex workers. Working in adherence to the philosophy of 'Nothing for Us without Us.'  We envision a world in which the basic and universal human rights of key populations are respected to enable them live with dignity, free from discrimination, persecution, and violence.  PITARP proposes to use a rights-based, evidence-informed, and community-owned approaches that use a mix of biomedical, behavioural, and structural interventions, prioritised to meet the current HIV prevention needs of key populations to have a sustained impact on reducing new infections. </p>

                            <p>Currently funded by the USAID Boresha Jamii and implementing in Kakamega County and in the Sub Counties of Matungu, Butere, Navakholo and Khwisero, PITARP provides  health, legal, information and social services. Health services provided are HIV prevention, treatment, care and support, and also services related to sexual reproductive health, tuberculosis, and viral hepatitis screening and referrals. Depending on the local context, vocational, psychosocial and legal care may also be provided.</p>

                            <p>According to the UNAIDS No single HIV prevention approach alone can stop the epidemic. Meeting ambitious 2020 and 2030 targets requires focused combination packages that offer a mix of proven high-impact HIV prevention interventions. These include condom provision, immediate initiation of antiretroviral therapy (ART) and pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP). Specific populations and locations require additional tools such as harm reduction (needle–syringe and opioid substitution therapy programmes) for people who inject drugs and voluntary medical male circumcision (VMMC) for men. PITARP CBO believes that Continued innovation is essential. This includes better technology—improved condoms, new male circumcision devices, long-acting antiretroviral medicines (ARVs)—and better programme delivery, including expanded community-based services, demand generation and adherence support, better integration with other health services, education and use of new media. </p>
                            
                            <p>Behavioural interventions seek to reduce the risk of HIV transmission by addressing risky behaviours. As such, behaviour change communication forms a basic component of combination prevention. Effective behaviour interventions address the cultural contexts within which risk behaviours occur, and aim to stimulate uptake of HIV prevention services (often referred to as ‘demand generation’). These programmes often feature intensive approaches involving a combination of activities to address multiple outcomes, including knowledge, risk perception, norms, skills, sexual behaviours and HIV service demand. At PITARP behavioural interventions include activities such as counseling and other forms of psycho-social support; peer education;  hotspots visits and hotspots validation; Community health education sessions; Condom and lubricant promotion; Risk assessment and risk reduction plans; PrEP demand creation activities; Screening for violence and substance abuse; Mental health talks and screening. Biomedical interventions use a mix of clinical and medical approaches to reduce HIV transmission. In order to be effective, biomedical interventions are rarely implemented independently and are often used in conjunction with behavioural interventions. For example, when a man is circumcised, he will often be tested for HIV and receive counselling and education about condom use and safer sex. Examples of biomedical interventions include: STIs screening and treatment, cervical cancer screening, family planning, HIV testing and counselling, PEP, PrEP services, trauma counselling and care and treatment services. Additionally, we keep on building synergies and enhanced linkages with government and partner health facilities for services such as: ART, Gender Based Violence (GBV) for those clients located far away from out DIC and lab works. Structural interventions seek to address underlying factors that make individuals or groups vulnerable to HIV infection. These can be social, economic, political or environmental. PITARP flags the following structural issues as creating gaps in HIV prevention:
                              <br><b>I).</b> Criminalisation and stigmatisation of same-sex relationships, cross-dressing, sex work and drug use
                              block HIV prevention services and increase risky behaviours.
                              <br><b>II).</b> Stigma and discrimination related to HIV and towards key populations in healthcare settings undermine access to HIV prevention and other health services.

                              <br><b>III).</b> Key populations face specific challenges and barriers, including violence and violations of their human rights, with women in key populations particularly affected.
                              <br><b>IV).</b> Homophobia is a barrier to HIV services for gay men and other men who have sex with men.
                              <br><b>V).</b> Gender inequalities, including gender-based violence, exacerbate women and girls’ vulnerability to HIV and block their access to HIV services.

                            <br><H4>Maximizing synergies in HIV prevention</H4>
                            <br><p>Positive Health, Dignity and Prevention:  Although each instance of primary HIV transmission requires the involvement of an HIV-infected and an HIV-uninfected person, prevention services have seldom focused on addressing the needs of people
                              living with HIV. Engaging HIV positive people in averting onward transmission is likely to be most effective in combination, with clinical and interpersonal interventions to increase ART access and adherence, counselling and support for safer sex, and structural approaches, including programmes to eradicate HIV-related stigma and discrimination and gender-based violence, as well as enhancing access to integrated sexual and reproductive health services, and community-building initiatives to organize and engage networks of people living with HIV.</p>

                            <br>Legal literacy : a strategy for pursuing justice that is working.
                          </p>
                          <p>This process of equipping the community to understand, use, and shape the law is not easy. We encounter corruption and steep power imbalances every day. Many paralegals face threats of retaliation. But despite these challenges, we are seeing real progress against injustice in the areas where we work. And the Legal Empowerment Network is the strongest it’s been.</p>
                           <p><b>How We have Created Impact in the areas we work :</b></p>
                          <br>
                        <p><b>1. Paralegals work with communities to solve justice problems at the grassroots.</b> Together, they protect community by securing  basic rights to healthcare and citizenship. These remedies improve the lives of KPs and other community members.</p>
                        <p><b>2. The individuals who work closely with the paralegals learn about their rights and how to realize them using the law.</b> They often go on to support others in their communities, creating ripples of empowerment.</p>
                        <p><b>3. We draw on grassroots experience to advocate for changes that make the system better for everyone.</b> Paralegals rigorously collect data on every case they handle. We assess that information to identify where systems are failing and how they can be improved. Together with the communities with which we work, we use that information to advocate for reforms to laws and policies. These changes can positively affect entire nations.</p>
                        <p><b>4. We learn from each other to get better.</b> We foster learning among network members, online and in-person. By sharing evidence, challenges, and lessons from practice, our community becomes more effective.</p>
                        <p><b>5. We strive to transform the policy environment for legal empowerment.</b>Together with network members, we advocate for policies that will create the space and structures for our members to work effectively and independently.
